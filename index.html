        <h2>About the Series</h2>
        <p>
          Attack on Titan is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by
          Hajime Isayama. It is set in a world where humanity is forced to live
          in cities surrounded by three enormous walls that protect them from
          gigantic man-eating humanoids referred to as Titans; the story follows
          Eren Yeager, who vows to exterminate the Titans after they bring about
          the destruction of his hometown and the death of his mother. It was
          serialized in Kodansha's monthly magazine Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine
          from September 2009 to April 2021, with its chapters collected in 34
          tankōbon volumes. An anime television series was produced by Wit
          Studio (seasons 1–3) and MAPPA (season 4). A 25-episode first season
          was broadcast from April to September 2013, followed by a 12-episode
          second season broadcast from April to June 2017. A 22-episode third
          season was broadcast in two parts, with the first 12 episodes airing
          from July to October 2018 and the last 10 episodes airing from April
          to July 2019. A fourth and final season premiered in December 2020,
          airing 16 episodes in its first part. A second part consisting of 12
          episodes aired from January to April 2022, and a third and final part
          will air in two halves; the first half premiered in March 2023, and
          the second half will premiere in late 2023. Attack on Titan has become
          a critical and commercial success. By September 2022, the manga had
          over 110 million copies in circulation, making it one of the
          best-selling manga series of all time. It has won several awards,
          including the Kodansha Manga Award, the Attilio Micheluzzi Award, and
          the Harvey Award.

        <h2>About Walls</h2>
        <p>
          The Walls (Maria,Rose,Sina) were three large structures located on
          Paradis Island that guarded the remnants of Eldia.They were built by
          the 145th King of Eldia, Karl Fritz, a century ago using countless
          Colossus Titans. They stalled the other nations from attacking
          Paradis, under the false threat that the King would unleash the Titans
          inside upon the world if they did so.The Walls crumbled about a
          century later when Eren Yeager used to the power of the Founding Titan
          to free the Titans within them.

              Eren Yēgār was a former member of the Survey Corps. He was the
              main protagonist of Attack on Titan. He lived in Shiganshina
              District with his parents until the fall of Wall Maria, where he
              impotently witnessed his mother being eaten by a Titan. This event
              would lead to Eren's intense hatred towards the Titans as he swore
              to wipe all of them off the face of the Earth.Later on he ate many
              of the biggest titans' owners to take their power in order to
              revange for his people especially for his mom by occuping the
              world.

              Discerning, intelligent, and widely respected, Erwin was an able
              commander.He taked alot of important lessons from his father which
              was a historical teacher before his death.While he cared deeply
              for his men, he did not hesitate to sacrifice them for the good
              and prosperity of mankind, and his men proved more than willing to
              stake their lives at his order. During Erwin's career he developed
              the Long-Distance Enemy Scouting Formation. He later named Hange
              Zoë as his successor.

              Armin Arlert is the 15th and current commander of the Survey
              Corps, named so by Hange Zoë before her death. He is also a
              childhood friend of Eren Yeager and Mikasa Ackerman, and one of
              the two deuteragonists of the series. Although he appears to be
              among the physically weakest of the 104th Training Corps, his
              intelligence and strategic genius makes him an invaluable asset,
              especially when paired with Hange. After the battle of Shiganshina
              District, he took the power of the Titans from Bertolt Hoover and
              came in possession of the Colossus Titan.
